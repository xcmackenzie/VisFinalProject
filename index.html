            <h1>Has BC Become More Diverse? <br><i style="font-size:35px">A look into the past 45 years</i></h1>
            <h5>Below we look at how the BC population has changed by ethnicity, gender, geographical region, and international status over the past 45 years. We also compared the ethnicity and gender distribution at BC to other peer institutions such as Georgetown, Notre Dame, Boston University, and Northeastern based off of their 2020 demographics. From these visualizations, we are better able to understand the demographic changes at BC and the extent to which it has become more diverse.</h5>

                <h5>In this visualization we can see that there has consistently been a higher number of female students enrolled in Boston College than male students over the past 45 years.  The difference was the most pronounced from around 1980-1990, when it then began to narrow until 2010.  The difference appears to be widening once again beginning from 2010 until today.</h5>

Since the 1980’s, The total undergraduate body has shifted slightly closer a 50/50 split of males to females but there has consistently been more females. MCAS, the school of arts and sciences very closely mirrors the trends of the overall student body. The Lynch School of Education and human development is predominantly female, though there has been an increase of male representation since the 1980’s. The nursing school shows a similar trend as LSOE, however the ratio is even more skewed towards females, except in 2000 where there was a considerable increase in male representation. The business school has become less diverse overtime. Though it has been consistently male dominated since the 80’s, this trend has become consistently more pronounced since 1985. </h5>
