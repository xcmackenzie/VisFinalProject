            <h1>Has BC Become More Diverse? <br><i style="font-size:35px">A look into the past 45 years</i></h1>
            <h5>Below we look at how the BC population has changed by ethnicity, gender, geographical region, and 
                international status over the past 45 years. We also compared the ethnicity and gender distribution at 
                BC to other peer institutions such as Georgetown, Notre Dame, Boston University, and Northeastern based 
                off of their 2020 demographics. From these visualizations, we are better able to understand the demographic 
                changes at BC and the extent to which it has become more diverse.</h5>  
        </div>
        <div class = "viz-container">
            <h3>Changes in Gender Distribution</h3>
            <h5>The overall number of students enrolled in Boston College has been variable throughout the last 45 years, 
                starting at a total of 9,899 in 1976 and increasing to a total of 10,767 enrolled students in 1980 before 
                showing a generally decreasing trend down to a total of 9,445 enrolled students in the Fall of 2020. The 
                university first went co-ed in 1970, with the first fully coeducational class graduating in the Spring of 1974. 
                Throughout the past 45 years, the number of male and female students has varied alongside the total number of 
                enrolled students.</h5>
            <div class = "row gender">
                <div class = "column">
                    <div id="chartContainer">
                        <button id="button" class = "button">Show Percentage Breakdown</button>
                        <p><strong>Number of Enrolled Undergraduate Students of Each Gender</strong></p>
                        <div class = "line-chart"></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class = "column">
                    <h5><br><br><br>We see that the number of female students enrolled in Boston College has consistently 
                        been greater than the number of male students over the past 45 years.  The difference was the most 
                        pronounced between 1980 and 1990, which interestingly corresponds very closely to the higher total 
                        number of students enrolled in those years.  Thus, it seems that in these years of higher enrollment, 
                        the majority of the additional enrolled students were female rather than male. Since then,the gap 
                        between the number of male and female students narrowed to a nearly constant difference until 2010, 
                        since when it has begun to widen once again.</h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h5>Despite the differences in the number of students of each gender over time, <mark>the percent of students of each gender has stayed reasonably constant at about 47-48% male.</mark> However, in the years where the difference in number between the two sexes were the highest (1980-1990), the percent gap widened slightly to an average of about 43% male.</h5>
        </div>
        <div class = "viz-container">
            <h5><br>Thus, the overall gender trends of the Boston College population as a whole has been majority-female. Where we begin to see more of a difference in male-female representation is in the different individual schools within BC.</h5>
            <p><i>Note: Boston College did not begin publishing the gender breakdown of students enrolled in each school until the year 1985.</i></p>
            <p><strong>Gender Distribution within Each of BC's Different Schools</strong></p>
            <div class = "pie-chart">
                <div id = "school-pie-chart"></div>
            </div>
            <h5>The Morrissey College of Arts & Sciences, BC's largest school, has reflected these trends the most closely.  Where we begin to see larger divides are the schools aimed towards fields which are traditionally dominated more by a single gender. Both the Lynch School of Education and Connell School of Nursing have been consistently female-dominated since 1976 by large, relatively consistent margins.</h5>
            <h5>On the other hand, the Carroll School of Management has consistantly been male-dominated since 1985, showing a clear departure from the overall tendency of the school to being majority female. The majority-male makeup of this school has actually become more pronounced over time, increasing from being 53% male in 1985 to 67% male in 2020. Given the overall increase in women in business across the world in the same time period, this trend is especially surprising.</h5>
            <h5>The Woods College of Advancing Studies has shown the most drastic change in gender demographics since 1985. While the school initially showed a female majority in 1985, the distribution has steadily changed to being majority-male as of 2020.</h5>

        <div class = "viz-container">
            <h3>Changes in Ethnic Distribution</h3>
            <h5>We next turn to an analysis of the ethnic distribution of students enrolled in Boston College since 1976. In contrast to the more consistent gender patterns of BC, BC has generally become a more ethnically diverse school in the past 45 years, yet the change has been slow.</h5>
            <div class = "row ethnicity">
                <div id = "stacked-area"></div>
                <h5><mark>Boston College has been, and continues to be, a majority-White school, though the White majority has decreased 
                    steadily throughout the years. </mark>Notably, the Asian population of the school has steadily increased in the past 
                    45 years, while the Native American population has been consistently low. The Hispanic and Black populations 
                    have been reasonably variable throughout the years, showing no consistent pattern of growth. The two or more
                    races category refers to students who identify with more than one race or ethnicity.</h5>
            </div>
            <div class = "row twomore">
                <div class = "column">
                    <h5><br><br><br>Furthermore, BC introduced a new "two or more races" category into its statistics in 2010. The visualization to the right breaks down the percent of students selecting the "two or more races" category who identify the given ethnicity as one of them. A high number of those identifying as two or more races identified either Hispanic or White as one them, which could possibly skew some of the patterns seen in the distribution of these ethnicities.</h5>

            <h5>To gain further insight into these ethnic distributions, we wanted to see how the distributions of BC compared to those of the United States overall.</h5>

                        increasingly over-represented within the BC community </mark>compared with the USA overall to an approximately 
                        100% difference in 2020. <mark>The Black and Hispanic populations have been consistently under-represented at 
                        BC by reasonably consistent margins, </mark> and it is evident that this problem has shown no signs of decreasing.</h5>

            <h3>Changes in Geographic Distribution</h3>
            <h5>As we have seen, despite the gender breakdown remaining constant, the ethnic diversity of enrolled students 
                shows signs of increasing. It seems that, in accordance with the increase in ethnic diversity, the geographic

            <h5>In 1976, the geographic distribution of students was fairly limited. The vast majority of students came from the Northeast, 
                with more than 70% of the student body coming from either Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, or Connecticut. In contrast, 
                the vast majority of the country was severely under-represented, with Illinois and Ohio being the only two states outside 
                of the Northeast with greater than 100 students. In 2020, however, we can see that this pattern has begun to change. 
                <mark>While the majority of students still seem to come from the Northeast (New York and Massachusetts continue to stand out), 
                the overall distribution has become much more even.</mark> The change is particularly noticeable for states such as California, 
                Texas, Florida, Minnesota, and Washington. However, there are still areas of the country which are under-represented, 
                such as Midwest states outside of the Great Lakes region and the majority of Southern States.</h5>

            <h5>The importance of the increase in geographic distribution of the student body of BC lies in its impacts on the diversity of the school. As we have seen that the student body has become more ethnically diverse, diversity in geographic background provides an increase in diversity of thought in the student population as well.  Having come from all across the world, Boston College students will have had incresingly different life experiences prior to coming to BC. This increase has the ability to make an incredibly positive impact on the student experience at BC, allowing for people to come together and share their own experiences while learning those of others to create a more stimulating academic environment.</h5>

        <h3>How Do BC's Demographics Compare to Peer Institutions?</h3>
        <h5>While Boston College has clearly become more a more ethnically and geographically diverse school over time, it is valuable to examine how its current gender and ethnic distributions compare to those of several peer institutions. We chose to focus specifically on Boston University (BU), Georgetown, Notre Dame, and Northeastern.</h5>

                        actually had a more prominent White majority than any other school, and was significantly less 
                        represented in the Asian population than the others. In general, the Asian population was 
                        over-represented across all schools in comparison to the US, while the Hispanic population seems 
                        to be generally on-par with that of the US. <mark>However, both the Black and Native American populations
                         are under-represented at all schools compared to USA totals, with the Native American populations

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <h5>
                BC has consistently become more diverse in the gender, ethnic and international student distribution since 1975, 
                though not by a huge margin. The gender distribution has evened out with a decreasing proportion of females and 
                an increasing proportion of men. The percentage of white students has slowly decreased from 94% to 65% with a 
                large increase in Asian students and a small increase of Black, Hispanic and multicultural students. International 
                students have made a large impact in BC’s diversity with an increase from 1.09% to 7.7% of the student body. In 
                comparison with other private and neighboring universities, BC has similar gender distributions and a 
                similar ethnic makeup, though BU and Northeastern reach higher levels of diversity by a small margin. 
                BC has consistently become more diverse since 1975 but still has plenty of room to grow 
                to match and exceed neighboring universities like BU and Northeastern.
