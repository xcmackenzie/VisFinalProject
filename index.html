            <h1>Has BC Become More Diverse? <br><i style="font-size:30px;color:#b29d6c;">A look into the past 45 years at Boston College</i></h1>
            <h5>Below we examine how the Boston College (BC) undergraduatepopulation has changed by ethnicity, gender, geographical region, and 
                international status over the past 45 years. We also compared the ethnicity and gender distribution at 
                BC to other peer institutions such as Georgetown, Notre Dame, Boston University, and Northeastern based 
                off of their 2020 demographics.<br><br><i>** All of the information included below is based on undergraduate students only and is gathered from the BC Factbook Archives. **</i></h5>

            <h3>Changes in Gender Distribution</h3>
            <h4>Student Body Overview</h4>
            <h5>The overall number of students enrolled in Boston College has been variable throughout the last 45 years, 
                starting at a total of 9,899 in 1976 and increasing to a total of 10,767 enrolled students in 1980 before 
                showing a generally decreasing trend down to a total of 9,445 enrolled students in the Fall of 2020. The 
                university first went co-ed in 1970, with the first fully coeducational class graduating in the Spring of 1974. 
                Throughout the past 45 years, the number of male and female students has varied alongside the total number of 
                enrolled students.</h5>
            <div class = "row gender">
                <div class = "column">

                    <br>
                    <h4>Male-Female Breakdown</h4>
                    <h5>We see that the number of female students enrolled in Boston College has consistently 
                        been greater than the number of male students over the past 45 years.  The difference was the most 
                        pronounced between 1980 and 1990, which interestingly corresponds very closely to the higher total 
                        number of students enrolled in those years.  Thus, it seems that in these years of higher enrollment, 
                        the majority of the additional enrolled students were female rather than male. Since then,the gap 
                        between the number of male and female students narrowed to a nearly constant difference until 2010, 
                        since when it has begun to widen once again.</h5>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Gender Distribution Change Overall</h4>
            <h5>Despite the differences in the number of students of each gender over time, <b>the percent of students of each gender has stayed reasonably constant at about 47-48% male.</b> However, in the years where the difference in number between the two sexes were the highest (1980-1990), the percent gap widened slightly to an average of about 43% male.</h5>
        </div>
        <div class = "viz-container">
            <br>
            <h4>Gender Distribution by School</h4>
            <h5>The overall gender trends of the Boston College population has been that the university is majority-female. Where we begin to see more of a difference in male-female representation is within the  individual schools at BC.</h5>
            <p><i>Note: Boston College did not begin publishing the gender breakdown of students enrolled in each school until the year 1985.</i></p>
            <p><strong>Gender Distribution within Each of BC's Different Schools</strong></p>
            <div class = "pie-chart">
                <div id = "school-pie-chart"></div>
            </div>
            <h4>MCAS and Woods College</h4>
            <h5>The Morrissey College of Arts & Sciences, BC's largest school, has reflected the overall university gender trends the most closely. This is likely due to the wide variety of majors in MCAS that interest both male and female students. Conversely, The Woods College of Advancing Studies has shown the most drastic change in gender demographics since 1985. While the school initially showed a female majority in 1985, the distribution has steadily changed to being majority-male as of 2020.</h5>
            <h4>Gender Discrepencies in Business, Education and Nursing Schools</h4>
            <h5>Where we begin to see larger divides in the gender distribution are in the schools aimed towards fields which are traditionally dominated more by a single gender. Both the Lynch School of Education and Connell School of Nursing have been consistently female-dominated since 1976 by large, relatively consistent margins. <strong>There has been a very small increase in male representation within the LSOE since 2000. However, though there is a disproportinate representation of females in CSON, it has been decreasing since 2000 and the percentage of men has almost tripled. </strong></h5>
            <h5>On the other hand, the Carroll School of Management has consistantly been male-dominated since 1985, showing a clear departure from the overall tendency for Boston College being majority female. <strong>The majority-male makeup of CSOM has actually become more pronounced over time, increasing from being 53% male in 1985 to 67% male in 2020.</strong> Given the overall increase in women in business across the world in the same time period, this trend is especially surprising.</h5>

            <h3>Changes in Ethnic Distribution</h3>
            <h4>Distribution Overview</h4>
            <h5>We next turn to an analysis of the ethnic distribution of students enrolled in Boston College since 1976. In contrast to the more consistent gender patterns of BC, BC has generally become a more ethnically diverse school in the past 45 years, yet the change has been slow.</h5>
            <div class = "row ethnicity">
                <div id = "stacked-area"></div>
                <h5><strong>Boston College has been, and continues to be, a majority-White school, though the White majority has decreased 
                    steadily throughout the years. </strong>Notably, the Asian population of the school has steadily increased in the past 
                    45 years, while the Native American population has been consistently low. <strong>The Hispanic and Black populations 
                    have been reasonably variable throughout the years, showing no consistent pattern of growth.</strong> The two or more
                    races category refers to students who identify with more than one race or ethnicity.</h5>

                    <h4>"Two or More Races" Breakdown</h4>
                    <h5>Furthermore, BC introduced a new "two or more races" category into its statistics in 2010. The visualization to the right breaks down the percent of students selecting the "two or more races" category who identify the given ethnicity as one of them. A high number of those identifying as two or more races identified either Hispanic or White as one them, which could possibly skew some of the patterns seen in the distribution of these ethnicities.</h5>

                    <h4>BC Students Compared to US</h4>
                    <h5>To gain further insight into these ethnic distributions, we wanted to see how the distributions of BC compared to those of the United States overall.<strong>The undergrad population of BC is considerably and consistently more white than the USA population, </strong>
                        and has been for the duration of the past 45 years. Additionally, <strong>the Asian population of BC has been 
                        increasingly over-represented within the BC community </strong>compared with the USA overall to an approximately 
                        100% difference in 2020. <strong>The Black and Hispanic populations have been consistently under-represented at 
                        BC by reasonably consistent margins, </strong> and it is evident that this problem has shown no signs of decreasing.</h5>

                    <h5> Though the population of White students has decreased and begun to reflect the overall US population more, the representation of Black and Hispanic Students at BC has made little improvement.</h5>

            <h3>Changes in Geographic Distribution</h3>
            <h4>Distribution Overview</h4>
            <h5>As we have seen, despite the gender breakdown remaining constant, the ethnic diversity of enrolled students 
                shows signs of increasing. It seems that, in accordance with the increase in ethnic diversity, the geographic

            <h4>Geographic Distribution Patterns</h4>
            <h5>In 1976, the geographic distribution of students was fairly limited. The vast majority of students came from the Northeast, 
                with more than 70% of the student body coming from either Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, or Connecticut. In contrast, 
                the rest of the country's regions were under-represented, with Illinois and Ohio being the only two states outside 
                of the Northeast with greater than 100 students. In 2020, however, we can see that this pattern has begun to change. 
                <strong>While the majority of students still seem to come from the Northeast (New York and Massachusetts continue to stand out), 
                the overall distribution has become much more even.</strong> The change is particularly noticeable for states such as California, 
                Texas, Florida, Minnesota, and Washington. However, there are still areas of the country which are under-represented, 
                such as midwest states outside of the Great Lakes region and the majority of southern states.</h5>

                    <h4>International Student Distribution</h4>
                    <h5>In addition to the increase in diversity in terms of geographic distribution of US-born students,<strong> the percent of international students at BC has increased considerably since 1976.</strong> This trend of an increase in international students coincides with increase in students from parts of the United States outside of the Northeast. This shows that BC's student body is increasingly coming from different areas of the world.</h5>

                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Importance of Diversity</h4>
            <h5>The importance of the increase in geographic distribution of the student body at BC lies in its impacts on the diversity of the school. Diversity in geographic background provides an increase in diversity of thought in the student population as well.  Having come from all across the world, Boston College students will have had incresingly different life experiences prior to coming to BC. This increase has the ability to make an incredibly positive impact on the student experience at BC, allowing for people to come together and share their own experiences while learning those of others to create a more stimulating academic environment.</h5>
        </div>
        <h3>How Do BC's Demographics Compare to Peer Institutions?</h3>
        <h5>While Boston College has clearly become more a more ethnically and geographically diverse school over time, it is valuable to examine how its current gender and ethnic distributions compare to those of several peer institutions. We chose to focus specifically on Boston University (BU), Georgetown, Notre Dame, and Northeastern.</h5>
        <div class = "viz-container">
            <div class = "row comparison">

                    <br><br><br>
                    <h4>Ethnicity Demographics</h4>
                    <h5><strong>Each of the schools that we looked at (and the United States in general) were also 
                        majority-White, though BU, Georgetown and Northeastern are to a lesser extent.</strong> Notre Dame 
                        actually had a more prominent White majority than any other school, and was significantly less 
                        represented in the Asian population than the others. In general, the Asian population was 
                        over-represented across all schools in comparison to the US, while the Hispanic population seems 
                        to be generally on-par with that of the US. <strong>However, both the Black and Native American populations
                         are under-represented at all schools compared to USA totals, with the Native American populations 
                         being nearly non-existent at each university.</strong></h5>  
                </div>

                    <br><br><br>
                    <h4>Gender Demographics</h4>
                    <h5><strong>Almost all of the peer institutions that we examined shared BC's majority-female demographics, </strong>with both BU and Georetown having an even higher female majority. The only peer institution which is majority male in 2020 is Notre Dame, while Northeastern is the closest to being truly 50-50 in terms of gender.</h5>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <h5>
                BC has consistently become more diverse in the gender, ethnic and international student distribution since 1975, 
                though not by a huge margin. The gender distribution has evened out with a decreasing proportion of females and 
                an increasing proportion of men. The percentage of white students has slowly decreased from 94% to 65% with a 
                large increase in Asian students and a small increase of Black, Hispanic and multicultural students. International 
                students have made a large impact in BC’s diversity with an increase from 1.09% to 7.7% of the student body. In 
                comparison with other private and neighboring universities, BC has similar gender distributions and a 
                similar ethnic makeup, though BU and Northeastern reach higher levels of diversity by a small margin. 
                BC has consistently become more diverse since 1975 but still has plenty of room to grow 
                to match and exceed neighboring universities like BU and Northeastern.
