            <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
            <h5>Our motivation was to see how BC's demographics have changed throughout
              the past half-century. We thought that this would be interesting because it is important 
              to reflect on where BC has come from and how it has changed over time to see its own growth and trends, 
              as well as have a more holistic view of its history. We recognize that the best way to keep a community like BC
          evolving and growing is to continue to search for a diverse population of students when admitting new classes. Hopefully
          this website can help provide some context on the areas that Boston College should improve in to maintain this level of 
              intellectual stimulation on campus. </h5>

            <h2>Data Processing</h2>
            <h5>Our data is collected from the Boston College's Admissions website
          and the factbook archives for each academic year at Boston College. We gathered data from these factbooks in 5 academic year intervals, starting with 1976. From this we plugged relevant information into Excel
          files and converted them into CSVs. Our data included enrollment numbers, gender distribution,
          ethnic distribution, racial distribution, as well numbers between US States and the four different
          schools at Boston College, which are: Carroll School of Management (CSOM), Morrissey College of Arts
          and Sciences (MCAS), Lynch School of Education (LSOE) and Connell School of Nursing (CSON). For additional 
          points of comparison, we also gathered population data for the United States as well as 
          data from peer institutions of BC including Boston University, Georgetown, Northeastern, and Notre Dame. 
          This additional data was taken from the US Census Bureau and the Common Data Sets of each institution respectively.
          After processing the data, we started to examine the trends in order to determine which visualizations would be appropriate in
          our design processes.</h5>

            <h2>Design Processes</h2>
            <h5>In the beginning stages of our design process, we focused on the more general facets of the data that we wanted to examine.
            These different categories included the gender makeup, ethnic distribution, and geographic distribution of undergraduate students
            enrolled in Boston College. We used a combined line/stacked bar chart, stacked area chart, and chloropleth maps respectively to do so.
            After fleshing out these main topics, we decided to dive deeper into each piece of data by looking next at the gender breakdown within 
            each of BC's different schools, the composition of the "Two or More Races" ethnicity that was introduced in
            BC's classifications in 2010, and the percentage of international students. This included the creation of a group of pie charts, 
            bar chart, and line chart for each subject. Finally, to enrich our discussion of the topic, we wanted to look at some data from different
            sources to show some points of comparison to BC's demographic distributions. Thus, we created a dot plot and two stacked bar charts to 
            compare each distribution with those of the US as a whole and with peer institutions.</h5>
            <h5>Across all of our design processes, we decided that some of the best visuals to have would be interactive. Many of the
            variables amongst students can be correllated and it's important for readers to be able to learn about relationships
            between the data. While the variables of gender, ethnicity and race might not be able to explain one another, there may be
            correlations in those variables within the individual schools of Boston College, as well as other inferences and conclusions
            that can be drawn by the reader regarding the population make-up of the university. For this, it was important to let the 
            reader be able to press or hover on a part of the visualization that will lead them to another visualization. We made sure
            to incorporate different charts (bar charts, area charts, maps) with captivating, yet accessible graphics.</h5>
