            <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
            <h5>Our motivation was to see how BC's demographics have changed throughout
              the past half-century. We thought that this would be interesting because it is important 
              to reflect on where BC has come from and how it has changed over time to see its own growth and trends, 
              as well as have a more holistic view of its history. </h5>

            <h2>Data Processing</h2>
            <h5>What we did to collect our data was visit Boston College's Admissions website
          to find factbooks on the school for each academic year. We decided to focus and compare trends
          between every 5 academic years starting with 1976. From this we plugged the information into Excel
          files and then converted them into CSVs. Our data included enrollment numbers, gender distribution,
          ethnic distribution, racial distribution, as well numbers between US States and the four different
          schools at Boston College, which are: Carroll School of Management (CSOM), Morrissey College of Arts
          and Sciences (MCAS), Lynch School of Education (LSOE) and Connell School of Nursing (CSON). After processing
          this data, we started to examine the trends in order to determine which visualizations would be appropriate in
          our design processes.</h5>
