            <h2>Project Motivation</h2>
            <h5>Our motivation was to see how BC's demographics have changed throughout
              the past half-century. We thought that this would be interesting because it is important 
              to reflect on where BC has come from and how it has changed over time to see its own growth and trends, 
              as well as have a more holistic view of its history. We recognize that the best way to keep a community like BC
          evolving and growing is to continue to search for a diverse population of students when admitting new classes. Hopefully
          this website can help provide some context on the areas that Boston College should improve in to maintain this level of 
              intellectual stimulation on campus. </h5>

            <h2>Data Processing</h2>
            <h5>What we did to collect our data was visit Boston College's Admissions website
          to find factbooks on the school for each academic year. We decided to focus and compare trends
          between every 5 academic years starting with 1976. From this we plugged the information into Excel
          files and then converted them into CSVs. Our data included enrollment numbers, gender distribution,
          ethnic distribution, racial distribution, as well numbers between US States and the four different
          schools at Boston College, which are: Carroll School of Management (CSOM), Morrissey College of Arts
          and Sciences (MCAS), Lynch School of Education (LSOE) and Connell School of Nursing (CSON). For additional 
          points of comparison, we also gathered some population data from the United States in general as well as 
          data from peer institutions of BC including Boston University, Georgetown, Northeastern, and Notre Dame. 
          This additional data was taken from the US Census Bureau and the Common Data Sets of each institution respectively.
          After processing the data, we started to examine the trends in order to determine which visualizations would be appropriate in
          our design processes.</h5>

            <h2>Design Processes</h2>
            <h5>For our design processes, we decided that some of the best visuals to have would be interactive. Many of the
          variables amongst students can be correllated and it's important for readers to be able to learn about relationships
          between the data. While the variables of gender, ethnicity and race might not be able to explain one another, there may be
          correlations in those variables within the individual schools of Boston College, as well as other inferences and conclusions
          that can be drawn by the reader regarding the population make-up of the university.</h5>
